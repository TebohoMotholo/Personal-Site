                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>Hi, I'm Teboho Motholo, an IT Support Technician at Finbond Mutual Bank. With a passion for technology and problem-solving, I provide both remote and on-site support for our branches, ensuring seamless operations and satisfied customers.

                    <div class="about-us">
                        <h3>Professional Background</h3>
                        <p>I currently work at Finbond Mutual Bank, where I am responsible for troubleshooting technical issues, maintaining hardware and software systems, and providing excellent customer service. In this role, I manage a wide range of IT support tasks, including network installations, desktop and laptop troubleshooting, and setting up new machines with the proper documentation and legal licenses. I also use various remote support tools like TeamViewer, VNC, Awesun, Splashtop, and Miradore to assist users across our branches.</p>
                        <p>Before joining Finbond, I worked at Makro Store Bloemfontein, where I honed my skills in IT support and infrastructure management. At Makro, I was responsible for setting up wired and wireless networks, maintaining IT hardware and software inventories, and providing first-line support to end users. This role allowed me to develop a strong foundation in IT operations, user support, and network management.</p>
                        <p>In addition to my professional experience, I have a robust educational background in IT. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from North West University, Free State. My education has provided me with a deep understanding of IT principles and practices, which I apply daily in my work.</p>

                        <h3>Personal Story</h3>
                        <p>My journey in IT started when I provided basic technical support for teachers and learners in my first job. This initial experience ignited my passion for technology and helping others. I found great satisfaction in troubleshooting internet connections, updating antivirus software, and assisting with device inventory updates. These early responsibilities taught me the importance of patience, clear communication, and attention to detail.</p>
                        <p>Over the years, I've grown from assisting in educational environments to my current position at Finbond Mutual Bank. Each step of my journey has been driven by a love for technology and a commitment to helping others. I've embraced new challenges, learned from my experiences, and continuously sought to improve my skills.</p>
                        <p>One of the most rewarding aspects of my career is the opportunity to make a tangible impact on people's daily lives. Whether I'm setting up a new workstation, resolving a network issue, or providing remote support, I know that my work helps colleagues and customers operate more efficiently and effectively.</p>
                        <p>Looking ahead, I am excited about the future of technology and the possibilities it holds. I am committed to staying current with industry trends and advancements, ensuring that I can continue to provide the highest level of support to those I serve. My ultimate goal is to grow into a leadership role where I can mentor and guide other IT professionals, fostering a culture of excellence and innovation.</p>
